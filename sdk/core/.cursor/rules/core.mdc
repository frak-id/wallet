# Core SDK Rules

## Core SDK Summary

`@/sdk/core` is part of Frak monorepo and is designed designed to facilitate the integration of the Frak Wallet.
`@/sdk/core` is foundational to the SDKâ€™s design, serving as the central hub that exposes client functions, utilities, constants, types, and error handlers.

`@/sdk/core/src/actions` is essentially the "action layer" of the Frak SDK. It collects together all of the functions that:

- Trigger wallet modals and embedded UIs,
- Send notifications or transaction interactions,
- Handle user authentication including SSO and SIWE,
- Monitor wallet status dynamically,
- Manage referrals and interaction tracking,
- And build complex modals using a configurable, step-by-step approach.

`@/sdk/core/src/interactions` encapsulates the logic necessary to convert various high-level user events into low-level, encoded data structures. These structures can then be transmitted to the Frak Wallet system for processing, ensuring a robust and standardized approach to tracking user interactions across press, purchase, referral, retail, and webshop domains.
