# Backend v2 todo:

 - ECS with:
    - Elysia
    - BullMQ

Multiple container for elysia? Like one only for wallet, and another for business + example? Cost impact? Not needed atm

AWS SQS -> BullMQ
    - Reduce dependency on AWS ecosystem
    - But use AWS Elasticache for Redis

Keep the ECS unexposed to internet, and use ALB internal DNS to communicate with it

- Drizzle for Elysia? for pg
- Push notifications managed via a pg db? We got a lot of room on it atm, and we could scale it up to contain:
    - eRPC cache
    - ponder indexing
    - wallet + business large datas

Advantages of pg:
    - We already have it
    - We can scale it up
    - We stay within AWS (and we could spin up a pg elsewhere if needed), but this way we reduce outbound trafic and have a better latency

Migration steps:
    1. Craft a few Elysia endpoints (example, and business related atm)
    2. Setup ECS with docker for Elysia
    3. Migrate from lambda to Elysia for the endpoints developed
    4. If that's going well, move every others aws lambda functions to Elysia + some NextJS actions (and call them via mutations)
    5. Use Elysia Eden client for communication, typesafe for the win
    6. Setup BullMQ and move queue to it
