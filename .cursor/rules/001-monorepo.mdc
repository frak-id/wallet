# Monorepo Rules

## Monorepo Summary

This is a Monorepo that defines multiple projects under `@/packages`, `@/sdk` and `@/example` directories.
Projects are written in TypeScript, SST and Pulumi for deploying, toolings with Bun, Biome, Changesets and Typedoc.

This monorepo contain all the ressources used for the Frak-Labs ecosystem, frontends, exemple, backends.
Every components of the ecosystem are critical, with a very high-work loads. 
Performance is mandatory on every part of this monorepo.

## Technical Stack

- Typedoc for commenting
- Changesets for packages versioning
- Bun as package manager, do not use npm, pnpm or yarn
- SDK Build Tools: tsdown (NPM packages: ESM+CJS+types) + esbuild (CDN bundles: IIFE/ESM)
  - Dual-tool approach: tsdown cannot do code splitting or separate output dirs (required for CDN)
  - Industry standard for libraries requiring both NPM and CDN distribution

## Key Principles

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

##  TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer types over interfaces.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript types.
- Use absolute imports for all files @/...
- Avoid try/catch blocks unless there's good reason to translate or handle error in that abstraction

##  Syntax and Formatting

- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. 
- Event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Always use async/await over callbacks

## Best Practices

- Ensure secure, efficient code following RESTful API best practices
- Respect SOLID principles
- Respect DRY principles
- Focus on performance and readability

## Documentation and Comments

- Write comprehensive documentation
- Include detailed comments explaining infrastructure decisions and implications
- Avoid personal pronouns in documentation
- Keep documentation up to date with changes

## Rewrite, Improve, and Refactor:

- When refactoring or fixing code, make sure to keep the code clean and easy to understand without duplicating code.
- Keep the code clean and easy to understand.
- Keep the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- Keep the code clean and easy to understand.
- After fixing an issue, mention the case in the docstring so future changes won't break it again.

## Planning:

- Always plan the code before writing it.
- Think about how the new code will fit into the existing codebase.
- Think about how the new code will interact with the other parts of the codebase.
- Think about how the new code will handle errors and edge cases.
- Think about how the new code will interact with the blockchain.
- Think about how the new code will be used by the developers.
