# Monorepo Frontend Rules

## Frontend Summary

In the repo we have multiple frontend:
 - `apps/business`: Business dashboard built with TanStack Start for companies, SaaS dashboard with blockchain interaction.
 - `apps/dashboard`: Legacy Next.js business dashboard (being replaced by apps/business).
 - `apps/wallet`: User facing SPA application with high workloads, can also be loaded via an iframe (uses React Router v7).
 - `apps/listener`: Iframe communication app for SDK interactions.
 - `packages/wallet-shared`: Shared components and utilities between the wallet and listener apps.
 - `example/*`: Example websites showcasing the setup of the Frak SDK.

## Technical Stack

- TypeScript
- React 19
- Radix UI and Shadcn UI for components
- CSS modules for styling
- React Query for server state management
- Zustand for client state management
- Viem and Wagmi for blockchain
- i18next for internationalization.
- Typedoc for commenting
- Viem library for low-level blockchain interactions.

- @ShadcnUI - Accessible and customizable components

## Key Principles

- You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI and CSS modules.
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

##  Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.
- Use BEM or a similar methodology for CSS modules classes (e.g., block__element--modifier).

##  Syntax and Formatting

- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.
- Always use CSS modules classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using Tailwind or tags.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Prefer async/await over callbacks

## React Guidelines
- Use functional components and hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Use Zustand for global state management in all frontend apps
- Always add "use client" directive to store files for Next.js compatibility
- Use individual selectors for optimal performance: `const value = store((state) => state.value)`
- Avoid subscribing to entire store: `const store = useStore()` causes unnecessary re-renders
- Store files should use persist middleware for localStorage synchronization when needed

## UI and Styling

- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and CSS modules for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with CSS modules; use a mobile-first approach.
- Build UI components using atomic design principles, organizing them from smallest to largest (e.g., atoms, molecules, organisms, pages).
