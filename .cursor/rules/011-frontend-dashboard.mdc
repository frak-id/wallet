# Dashboard Rules

## Dashboard Summary

`apps/dashboard` is part of Frak monorepo and is the **legacy** Next.js 15 business dashboard (being replaced by `apps/business` built with TanStack Start).

Project is written in TypeScript using React 19, Next.js App Router, Radix UI and Shadcn UI for components, React Query for server state management, Zustand for client state management, Viem and Wagmi for blockchain, i18next for internationalization.

## State Management

- Dashboard uses Zustand for global client state
- Store files located in `apps/dashboard/src/stores/`
- All stores must include "use client" directive at the top
- Stores use persist middleware for localStorage synchronization
- Best practices:
  - Use individual selectors: `const value = store((state) => state.value)`
  - Avoid whole-store subscriptions: `const { value } = store()` causes unnecessary re-renders
  - Support functional updates when needed: `setFilters((prev) => ({ ...prev, newValue }))`

## Technical Stack

- Next.js using App Router for all `*.tsx` files

## Resource Tags

Use these tags to find relevant documentation and resources:

- @NextJS - Next.js framework documentation and resources

## Key Principles

- You are an expert in TypeScript, Next.js, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI and CSS modules.

##  Performance Optimization

- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).

## Key Conventions

- Limit 'use client':
- Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
