# Changelog

All notable changes to the Frak PrestaShop module are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Add entries under `[Unreleased]` as you work. The release workflow
(`.github/workflows/release-prestashop.yml`) promotes `[Unreleased]` to the new
version on dispatch.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Banner component is now reachable**: previously `FrakComponentRenderer::banner()` existed but no PrestaShop hook ever invoked it. New auto-render placements expose it on `displayTop` and `displayHome` (both opt-in by default).
- **Auxiliary share-button placement**: opt-in `displayShoppingCart` placement so merchants can ship a “share your cart” referral CTA.
- **Placement registry** (`FrakPlacementRegistry`): single source of truth mapping each component × hook tuple to a `FRAK_PLACEMENT_*` Configuration toggle. Adding / removing a storefront surface is now a one-line registry edit — the install / uninstall / migration / dispatch paths read from the same list. Mirrors the WordPress plugin’s flexibility (block / shortcode / widget / Elementor) using PrestaShop’s native hook + Smarty surfaces instead of a block editor.
- **Smarty function plugins** (`{frak_banner}`, `{frak_share_button}`, `{frak_post_purchase}`): merchants can drop Frak components anywhere in their `.tpl` files or CMS pages without forking the module. Snake_case attribute keys are normalised to camelCase at the boundary so templates read naturally (`{frak_banner referral_title="..."}`). Mirrors WordPress’s `[frak_*]` shortcodes byte-for-byte.
- **Renderer**: `FrakComponentRenderer::snakeKeysToCamel()` public helper used by the Smarty boundary (and any future surface that arrives with snake_case input).
- **Admin: placement toggles**: one checkbox per registered placement, grouped by component. Reads / writes the `FRAK_PLACEMENT_*` Configuration rows. Hidden `__present` markers let the controller distinguish “unchecked” from “not in form” so toggles can be turned off.
- **Admin: webhook queue health panel**: surfaces pending / delivered / failed counts, the next-attempt timestamp, and the most recent error from `FrakWebhookQueue::stats()`. New “Drain now” button calls `FrakWebhookCron::run()` synchronously — useful when the cron URL has not been wired up yet, or to flush a backlog after fixing a backend outage.
- **`FrakWebhookQueue::stats()`**: aggregated `(state, count, oldest_pending_at)` snapshot plus the latest non-empty `last_error` row. Two queries total, indexed lookups only, safe to call on every admin render.

### Changed

- **Admin form**: collapsed the two separate Save buttons (Brand / Webhook) into a single “Save Settings” submit that also persists placement toggles. Refresh Merchant + Drain Queue moved to a dedicated “Maintenance” panel because they are stateful operations, not config writes.
- **PrestaShop module file layout**: schema lifecycle moved to `sql/install.php` + `sql/uninstall.php`; legacy-options sweep + cron-token provisioning + hook migration moved to `upgrade/install-1.0.1.php` (auto-discovered by PrestaShop on version bump). `index.php` directory-listing stubs added in every shipped directory; `override/` committed as an empty placeholder so the source tree mirrors the released zip layout.
- **Hook registration**: `install()` / `uninstall()` / `upgrade/install-1.0.1.php` now drive their hook lists from `FrakPlacementRegistry::distinctHooks()` instead of hard-coded chains. Removes the “forget to register a hook in three different places” failure mode.
- **Native PrestaShop versioning replaces `FRAK_SETTINGS_VERSION`**: PrestaShop's own `ps_module.version` is now the single source of truth for migration state. Existing v0.0.4 installs run `upgrade/install-1.0.1.php` once (auto-dispatched on first admin load after the version bump), which fixes two gaps the previous in-class sweep missed: the `FRAK_FLOATING_BUTTON_ENABLED` / `FRAK_FLOATING_BUTTON_POSITION` rows and the `displayFooter` hook registration.

### Removed

- `FrakIntegration::ensureSettingsMigrated()` + `cleanupLegacyOptions()` + `ensureCronTokenExists()` + `migrateOrderStatusHook()` and the `SETTINGS_VERSION` constant. Migration logic is now in `upgrade/install-1.0.1.php`, dispatched by PrestaShop's native upgrade discovery.
- `FrakWebhookQueue::createTable()` / `dropTable()`. Schema lifecycle lives in `sql/install.php` / `sql/uninstall.php` — single source of truth.

### Fixed

- **Webhook signature format**: send `base64_encode(hash_hmac('sha256', $body, $secret, true))` (raw bytes, base64-encoded) instead of the default hex digest, matching the backend's `Buffer.from(sig, 'base64')` decode in `validateBodyHmac`. Hex signatures decoded to a 64-byte buffer (vs the expected 32-byte raw digest) and silently failed verification on every dispatch.
- **Webhook endpoint URL**: switch from `/ext/merchant/{id}/webhook/prestashop` (which was never registered on the backend and 404’d every request) to `/ext/merchant/{id}/webhook/custom`, the existing route whose DTO already matches the PrestaShop payload shape.

### Changed

- **Order status hook**: switch from `actionOrderStatusUpdate` (pre-commit, raced under multistore / high load) to `actionOrderStatusPostUpdate` (post-commit), per the official PrestaShop docs.
- **Webhook timeouts**: tighten cURL request timeout to 5 s and connect timeout to 3 s (was 30 s / 10 s). Worst-case delay on the merchant’s checkout path is now bounded; failures hit the retry queue instead.

### Added

- **Async webhook retry queue** (`FrakWebhookQueue` + `FrakWebhookCron`): the order hook attempts a synchronous send with tight timeouts; any failure (network, non-2xx, exception) is enqueued into a custom `{prefix}frak_webhook_queue` table and retried by a cron drainer with exponential backoff (5 min → 24 h, 5 attempts max). Idempotent re-delivery via the backend’s `(merchantId, externalId, status)` dedupe key.
- **Cron front controller** (`controllers/front/cron.php`): token-guarded (`hash_equals` against `FRAK_CRON_TOKEN`) endpoint that drains the retry queue per tick. The full URL is shown on the admin configuration page so the merchant can wire it into `ps_cronjobs` or a server-level cron job.
- **Settings migrator**: existing installs auto-provision the queue table, generate `FRAK_CRON_TOKEN`, and re-register from the old `actionOrderStatusUpdate` hook to `actionOrderStatusPostUpdate` on first request after upgrade (rolled into the existing v2 settings bump).
- **Initial release of the Frak PrestaShop module.**
- Post-purchase tracker: inline `<script>` fires `window.FrakSetup.core.trackPurchaseStatus({customerId, orderId, token})` on the order-confirmation and customer order-detail pages, with a `frak:client` event fallback for the SDK-not-yet-ready race. Mirrors the WordPress `Frak_WooCommerce::render_purchase_tracker_for_order` flow.
- Post-purchase component: `<frak-post-purchase>` now auto-receives `products` (JSON-encoded line items: title / image URL / product link, capped at 6) on the order-confirmation page so the sharing UI can render product cards out of the box.
- New hook `displayOrderDetail`: customer My-Account → Orders → Detail page now renders the same `<frak-post-purchase>` + tracker pair, keeping attribution working when the merchant lands on the order via the post-checkout email link.
- New `views/templates/hook/post-purchase.tpl` Smarty partial: theme-overridable wrapper for the post-purchase markup. Override path: `themes/<theme>/modules/frakintegration/views/templates/hook/post-purchase.tpl`.
- New `FrakOrderResolver` class: single-pass extraction of customer/order/token context plus product line items from a resolved `Order`, fail-soft on missing images / deleted products. Sibling of the WordPress `Frak_WooCommerce::get_post_purchase_data()` helper.
